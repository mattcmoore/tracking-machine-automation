# Tracking Machine Automation
- This project is intended to automate the process of adding new operations tracking data to an Excel based TV network operations tracking machine.
- When we originally took on this project with did so without using any kind of version control system. It went on Github at a later date to save it for posterity, and for review. 
- It reflects the work of several, (pretty amatuerish at the time) developers building a more complex project in a professional setting.
